# sellar_MDO_architectures
The Sellar problem implemented in a variety of architectures using Python's SciPy. A replication of Tedford and Martins's 2010 paper [1], which uses software no longer available online. Therefore, anyone who wants to look at a practical implementation of these problems are free to study the code in this repository to help aid their understanding of MDO architectures.

This is a work in progress. I implement problems whenever I get a free moment.
